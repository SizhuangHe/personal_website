Hi! My name is Sizhuang He. I'm a first-year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [Yale University](https://www.yale.edu/). Previously, I completed my Bachelor's degree at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, majoring in Honors Mathematics and minoring in Computer Science.

I am dedicated to the development of deep learning methodologies with biomedical applications. My current research is centered around modeling continuous spatiotemporal dynamics using neural networks, grounded in theories of integral equations and iterative methods. Additionally, I have a keen interest in Geometric Deep Learning and Language Models and their applications in computational biology.

Currently, I am privileged to work at [the van Dijk Lab](https://www.vandijklab.org/), under the guidance of Dr. David van Dijk. I have been working on exciting projects involving Graph Neural Networks, generative modeling, and operator learning.

During my undergraduate studies, I have also worked on a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project focused on Federated Learning in Medical Applications, advised by Dr. [Maria Han Veiga](https://hanveiga.com/). This project sparkled my interest in machine learning.
